"""Qt adapter around the motionsense engine.

All detection, filtering, key output and camera handling now live in the SDK.
What is left here is the part that is genuinely application-specific: turning
SDK events into Qt signals, and SDK frames into ``QImage``.

The engine runs on this ``QThread`` (via the blocking ``engine.run``), so every
signal below is emitted from a thread Qt knows about, and the connections to the
GUI are ordinary queued connections.
